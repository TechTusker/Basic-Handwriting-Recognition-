# Basic Handwriting Recognition Model
This Python project uses TensorFlow and Keras to build and train a deep learning model for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. The neural network is composed of two hidden layers with ReLU activation functions and a final output layer with 10 units, representing the digits 0-9. After training, the model is evaluated for accuracy, saved, and tested on custom digit images processed with OpenCV. The predicted results are displayed along with the corresponding images using Matplotlib.

This Python project uses TensorFlow and OpenCV to build a deep learning model for handwritten digit classification based on the MNIST dataset. Here's a detailed breakdown of the project and its components:

(I)Loading and Preprocessing the Data:
The project starts by loading the MNIST dataset, which consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9), each 28x28 pixels in size. The dataset is split into two parts:

x_train and y_train: The training data (images and their corresponding labels).
x_test and y_test: The testing data (used to evaluate the model's performance).
Before feeding the data into the model, the images are normalized (scaled between 0 and 1) using TensorFlow's normalize() function to ensure consistent input for training, improving model performance.

(II)Building the Neural Network Model:
The project builds a Sequential model in TensorFlow using the tf.keras.models.Sequential() API. This model is a basic feedforward neural network with three layers:

Input layer: The Flatten() layer flattens the 28x28 input image into a 1D array of 784 pixels to serve as the input for the next layer.

Two Dense hidden layers: These are fully connected layers with 128 neurons each, using the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function, which introduces non-linearity to the model and helps it learn more complex patterns.

Output layer: This layer has 10 units, one for each possible digit (0-9), and uses the softmax activation function, which converts the outputs into probabilities.

(III)Compiling the Model:
The model is compiled with:

Adam optimizer: An efficient optimization algorithm that adjusts learning rates for better convergence.
Sparse categorical crossentropy loss: The loss function used when dealing with classification problems where the labels are integers.
Accuracy as the evaluation metric: It tracks the performance during training.

(IV)Training the Model:
The model is trained on the MNIST training dataset for 3 epochs (iterations over the entire dataset), adjusting the model's internal weights based on the data and the loss function.

(V)Evaluating the Model:
After training, the model is evaluated using the test data to measure its accuracy and loss on unseen data.

(VI)Saving the Model:
Once trained, the model is saved to the disk for later use using the model.save() function, specifying the file path to store it.

(VII)Making Predictions with Custom Images:
The project reads in five custom images (1.png, 2.png, etc.) using OpenCV. The images are inverted and reshaped to match the format required by the model. The trained model predicts the digit in each image, and the results are displayed using Matplotlib.

Explanation of Core Components:
MNIST Dataset: A well-known dataset of handwritten digits used for training image processing systems.
Normalization: Scaling the pixel values to a range of 0 to 1 ensures better model performance.
Sequential Model: A type of neural network where the layers are stacked sequentially, with each layer receiving input from the previous one.
Dense Layers: Fully connected neural network layers that learn complex representations of the input data.
Activation Functions:
ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit): Helps in learning non-linear relationships in the data.
Softmax: Converts the output of the neural network into a probability distribution.
Model Evaluation: Using accuracy to measure how well the model generalizes on new, unseen data.
Custom Image Prediction: Predicting handwritten digits from new images using OpenCV for image reading and processing.
Summary:
This project builds, trains, and evaluates a deep learning model using TensorFlow to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. After training, the model can predict digits from new images, making it a useful tool for digit recognition tasks. The model is built with three layers, utilizes ReLU and softmax activations, and achieves a high accuracy using the Adam optimizer.
